#About Shiok Companion Project

This is a Transdisciplinary Innovation Project initiated by Singapore Polytechnic Media Arts & Design school, where students of different discipline come together to build a prototype to solve a real life issue.
With collaboration with MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT), my team and I have come up with Shiok Companion;
A multi-functional app catered specially for active elderly between 45-60 years old, to encourage them to interact with their community more and to have a more convenient healthcare experience through features.
